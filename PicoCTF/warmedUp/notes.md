> the fourth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16, Multiply the fifth to the last digit by 16 x 16 x 16 x 16 and so on until all the digits are
> used.
> 
> Step 2) Add up all the products you got from Step 1 to get the answer to 0X3D in decimal.
> 
> Here is the math using using the steps above showing you how to convert 0X3D to decimal.
> 
> D x 1 = 13
> 3 x 16 = 48
> 
> 13 + 48 = 61
> 
> That is all there is to it. Here is the answer to 0X3D in decimal:
